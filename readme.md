# EasyHttp Versions | Ajax | Promises | Async/Await

This project consists of three versions of fetching data from an outside API.
A nice layer of abstraction is provided for the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
The "easyhttp.js" file in every version/folder is the `behind the scenes` implementation of the requests.

The API used is "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com".
